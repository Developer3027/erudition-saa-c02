# Cloudwatch

Cloudwatch is the goto tool for anything alarm, monitoring related. It works with rds, ec2 prem, cloudtrail, and lambda.

- system level, application level = cloudwatch
- monitoring aws standards and best practices = aws config
- default interval for delivered metrics is 5 min, while detailed monitoring is every 1 min.

Real time service is Kinesis, not CloudWatch.

Cloudwatch logs is the place for logs

- lambda, on-prem, ec2, rds, and CloudTrail all integrate with logs.
- CloudWatch Logs Insights allows a user to query logs in a sql type format.
